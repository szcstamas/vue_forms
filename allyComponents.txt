1. Always specify type in your input element.
2. Use fieldset to separate different forms and use legend for the headlines (for accessibility).
3. Always use labels referring to input IDs.
4. Never disable submit button (with disabled attribute) - make sure that screen readers see your disabled button.
    - use error messages instead: if something is wrong or invalid, throw error messages for the user to notify him
